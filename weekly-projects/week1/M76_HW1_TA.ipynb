    "This is an artificial tic-tac-toe bot that plays against a user. It follows a \"minimax\" algorithm, which is a recursive algorithm that determines the most optimal move by searching for the move that minimizes the maximum loss scenario. This is done by recursively searching through all possible moves and assigning a score to each 'game over' outcome. Then, the computer will choose a move with the maximum score. This is augmented by a 'depth' variable to ensure that the computer follows the fastest path to victory, or the slowest path to defeat. \n",
